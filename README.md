# tntvillage-relases-reader
Python script to open relases on TNTVillage through Internet Archive. Should be working, as far as Internet Archive is on.

# DISCLAIMER:
This is just a csv file parser, in the end; it's made for development and showing purposes, I am not responsable for bad usages of this or related.

# USAGE:
Place the relases file inside the folder of the script and rename it 'dump.csv'.
Run the script with code:
`python main.py`
