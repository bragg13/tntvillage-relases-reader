# tntvillage-relases-reader
Python script to open relases on TNTVillage through Internet Archive. Should be working, as far as Internet Archive is on.

# DISCLAIMER:
This is just a csv file parser, in the end; it's made for development and showing purposes, I am not responsable for bad usages of this or related.

# USAGE:
Place the relases file inside the folder of the script and rename it 'dump.csv'.

Open up *config.py* and edit CHROME_PATH parameter based on your Chrome Path.
If you wanna use this as a general csv parser, just edit URL parameter in *config.py* and the *fields* parameters in the main file.

Run the script with code:
`python main.py`
